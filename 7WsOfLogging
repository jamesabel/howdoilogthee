Use the 7 “W”’s that gives structure and format for  logging:
“log severity” categorizes the log message based on severity (FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, etc.)
“when” did it happen
“what” activity occurred; “what was the result”
“from where” provides information describing where the action was initiated from.
“who” initiated the action
“on what” resource did the activity target
“where” did the activity get observed, or modified in some way.
“to where” provides information describing where the target resource that is affected by the action is located.
